// Phase 8 batch 7. Real announcements, read-only for a guardian.
//
// A CLIENT-SIDE MISREADING IS FIXED BY DELETION. The prototype filtered to
// audience 'all', 'parents', 'students' and the child's class. Including
// 'students' was wrong: migration 14 is explicit that 'students' is visible to
// management only, because V1 issues students no logins, and that treating it as
// a guardian audience "would silently redirect a message meant for children to
// their parents".
//
// No audience filter is applied here at all now. The guardian SELECT policies
// decide readership: 'all' and 'parents' through announcements_guardian_select,
// plus class notices for a class their own child is enrolled in through
// announcements_guardian_class_select. 'students' is not among them, so it never
// arrives.
