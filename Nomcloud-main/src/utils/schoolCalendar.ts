// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// School calendar helpers.
//
// Rewritten in Phase 8 batch 0 to close the two deferred follow-ups this file
// previously carried as comments, both settled as decision 9 in
// docs/PHASE8_CONNECTION_PLAN.md:
//
//   1. The weekend was hardcoded to Saturday and Sunday, i.e. a Monday-to-Friday
//      week. Nom Cloud launches in Somalia, where the school week runs Sunday to
//      Thursday. schools.weekend_days has carried the correct value since Phase
//      3 and was already being fetched on every sign-in; it was simply ignored.
//
//   2. Dates were derived from new Date() and toISOString(), which is UTC.
//      Mogadishu is UTC+3, so between local midnight and 03:00 the application
//      computed YESTERDAY. attendance_records is keyed (school_id, student_id,
//      date), so a marker screen open late in the evening would have written to
//      the wrong day.
//
// Neither fix needed a schema change or a new dependency. Timezone-correct dates
// come from Intl.DateTimeFormat, which is built into every browser this project
// targets.
//
// DAY NUMBERING. Everything here speaks ISO 8601: 1 = Monday through 7 = Sunday,
// matching timetable_slots.day_of_week and schools.weekend_days. JavaScript's
// Date.getDay() uses 0 = Sunday through 6 = Saturday and is converted at the
// boundary by isoDayOfWeek. Nothing outside this file should call getDay().
