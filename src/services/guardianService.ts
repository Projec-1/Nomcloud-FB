// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Guardian to student resolution. Phase 8 batch 3.
//
// THIS FILE IS THE FIX FOR PLAN SECTION A.4.
//
// The bug: useSelectedChild resolved the signed-in guardian by comparing
// activeMembership.guardian_id, a real UUID, against mock parent ids 'p1' and
// 'p2' from the prototype seed. The comparison never matched, so every parent page
// rendered as though the account had no children. It has been broken for every
// real guardian since Phase 4 wired identity to Supabase while the data stayed
// mock.
//
// HOW "WHICH GUARDIAN IS THIS" IS RESOLVED NOW. The chain is entirely real and
// entirely server-side:
//
//   auth.uid()
//     -> memberships row with role = 'guardian'          (AuthContext)
//     -> memberships.guardian_id                          a real guardians.id
//     -> student_guardians (school_id, guardian_id)       the link rows
//     -> students (school_id, id)                         the children
//
// memberships.guardian_id is not a label the client chose. It is a composite
// foreign key, (school_id, guardian_id) -> guardians (school_id, id), written by
// accept_invitation at the moment the guardian redeemed their invitation. That
// is why it is trustworthy as the anchor.
//
// TENANT SCOPING. Both queries filter school_id and the specific guardian or
// student ids explicitly. Neither asks for a broad set and lets RLS narrow the
// answer. RLS is what makes a mistake safe, not what makes the query correct.
// Independently, is_guardian_of_student (batch 2 of the RLS rollout) means a
// guardian reading students sees only linked children even if this code were
// wrong, which is the belt and braces the design intends.
//
// WHY TWO QUERIES RATHER THAN ONE EMBEDDED SELECT. student_guardians reaches
// students through a COMPOSITE foreign key, (school_id, student_id). PostgREST
// resource embedding across composite foreign keys is not something to rely on
// silently, and a failure there would look like "this guardian has no children",
// which is precisely the bug being fixed. Two explicit queries cannot fail that
// way.
