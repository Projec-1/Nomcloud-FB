// Teaching records. Phase 8 batch 5 — THE FIRST BATCH THAT WRITES.
//
// Tables: attendance_records, grade_records, homework, homework_submissions,
// exams. The access model is not invented here. It is the one RLS migration 12
// (20260912000005_teaching_records_rls.sql) already enforces, restated so the
// interface can offer only what the database will accept:
//
//   table                 teacher READ        teacher WRITE
//   --------------------  ------------------  ----------------------------
//   attendance_records    teaches_class       teaches_class      (class-level)
//   grade_records         teaches_class       teaches_class_subject (EXACT)
//   homework              teaches_class       teaches_class_subject (EXACT)
//   homework_submissions  teaches_homework_-  teaches_homework
//                         class
//   exams                 teaches_class       teaches_class_subject (EXACT)
//
// Management (owner, director, administrator, principal) goes through
// can_manage_class on every one of these, which is CLASS-level, never
// subject-exact. That asymmetry is why ClassSummary.writableSubjects exists and
// why it is built differently on the two sides. See teacherService.ts.
//
// THE ASYMMETRY THAT SHAPES THE SCREENS. A teacher READS their whole class's
// grades and WRITES only their own subjects. So the subject selector on a
// grading screen is not the class's subject list; it is writableSubjects. A
// homeroom-only teacher gets an empty selector and no score inputs at all,
// rather than a form whose Save silently does nothing.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THE SUBJECT RESTRICTION IS ENFORCED IN THE INTERFACE AND NOT LEFT TO RLS
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// RLS filters rather than raises. A refused UPDATE reports zero rows and no
// error; only a refused INSERT reliably raises 42501. A screen that offered
// every subject of the class would therefore let a teacher type a column of
// marks for a subject they do not teach and, on Save, either see nothing happen
// or see a raw permission error. Both are bad, and neither tells them the real
// rule. The selector is narrowed instead, so the doomed write is never offered.
// RLS still refuses it independently if this code is ever wrong; that is the
// intended relationship, not a duplicate check.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// NO DERIVED COLUMNS HERE — VERIFIED, NOT ASSUMED
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// fee_records.amount_paid is maintained by a trigger, which is why RLS batch 5
// needed a column grant and a SECURITY DEFINER trigger to protect it. Nothing of
// that kind applies to these five tables. The only triggers any of them carry
// are the generic `<table>_set_updated_at BEFORE UPDATE ... set_updated_at()`
// timestamp triggers — confirmed against pg_trigger, not assumed. There is no
// computed score, no maintained total, no counter. A direct write is the normal
// and only path, so these functions write the columns straight.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ATTRIBUTION IS TAKEN FROM THE SESSION, NEVER FROM A PROP
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// attendance_records.marked_by, grade_records.recorded_by and
// homework.created_by are all FOREIGN KEYs to profiles(id) — the AUTH USER id.
// The policies check `col IS NULL OR col = auth.uid()`.
//
// The prototype passed `markedBy={activeMembership?.teacher_id}` into these
// screens. A teachers.id is a DIFFERENT uuid from the auth user id, so every one
// of those writes would have failed twice over: the foreign key would not
// resolve, and the policy comparison would not hold. The props are gone. These
// functions read the id from the live session, which is also the only value that
// can possibly satisfy auth.uid(), so no caller can get it wrong.
//
// TENANT SCOPING. Every read pins school_id plus an explicit id list. None asks
// broadly and lets RLS narrow it.
