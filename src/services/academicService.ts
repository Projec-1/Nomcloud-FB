// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Academic structure: academic years, terms, subjects. Phase 8 batch 2.
//
// TENANT SCOPING. Every query filters `.eq('school_id', schoolId)` explicitly
// rather than selecting the whole table and letting RLS narrow it. RLS is the
// boundary that makes a mistake safe; it is not the mechanism the application
// should depend on to be correct.
//
// HOW "CURRENT" IS DERIVED. The two are derived differently, because the schema
// expresses them differently, and the difference matters.
//
//   CURRENT ACADEMIC YEAR is a stored fact. academic_years.status carries
//   'upcoming' | 'active' | 'closed', and the database enforces at most one
//   active year per school with a partial unique index:
//
//     CREATE UNIQUE INDEX academic_years_school_id_active_idx
//       ON public.academic_years (school_id) WHERE status = 'active'
//
//   So the active year is read, never computed. Note that
//   schools.active_academic_year_id does NOT exist: Amendment 14 removed it
//   precisely so there is one source of truth. The mock's
//   SchoolSettings.academicYearId is a leftover of that removed column and is
//   not reintroduced here.
//
//   CURRENT TERM is NOT stored. public.terms has no status column, only name,
//   start_date, end_date and sort_order. The current term is therefore the term
//   of the active year whose date range contains today, evaluated in the
//   school's own timezone using the batch 0 calendar helpers.
//
//   Between terms — holidays — no term contains today and currentTerm is null.
//   That is reported honestly rather than papered over by snapping to the
//   nearest term, because the sensible fallback differs by screen and inventing
//   one rule here would hide the gap. Which term a new grade or fee defaults to
//   during a holiday is a real question for batches 5 and 6.
//
//   The mock's CURRENT_TERM = 'Term 1' is a hardcoded string with no
//   relationship to any date. It is not reconciled to; it is replaced.
