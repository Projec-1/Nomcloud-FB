// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Teacher to class resolution. Phase 8 batch 4.
//
// THIS FILE IS THE SECOND HALF OF THE FIX FOR PLAN SECTION A.4.
//
// The bug, identical in shape to the one batch 3 fixed on the parent side:
// seven teacher pages resolved their classes with
//
//   classes.filter((c) => c.teacherId === activeMembership?.teacher_id)
//
// where classes[].teacherId is 't1'..'t8' from the prototype seed and
// activeMembership.teacher_id is a UUID. The comparison never matched, so a real
// signed-in teacher saw an empty dashboard, an empty class list, and empty
// everything else.
//
// HOW "WHICH TEACHER IS THIS" IS RESOLVED NOW. The same chain batch 3 used,
// with teacher_id in place of guardian_id:
//
//   auth.uid()
//     -> memberships row with role = 'teacher'           (AuthContext)
//     -> memberships.teacher_id                           a real teachers.id
//     -> classes / class_subjects                         the assignments
//
// memberships.teacher_id is a composite foreign key,
// (school_id, teacher_id) -> teachers (school_id, id), written by
// accept_invitation when the teacher redeemed their invitation. The positive
// role/identity CHECK on memberships guarantees teacher_id is present exactly
// when role = 'teacher', so a non-teacher membership yields null.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// "ASSIGNED TO TEACH" — REUSED, NOT RE-DERIVED
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The definition is the one established in RLS batch 3 (migration
// 20260912000004) and reused unchanged by RLS batch 4 (20260912000005):
//
//   a teacher is assigned to class C when their teachers.id appears in
//     classes.class_teacher_id      for C            (homeroom), OR
//     class_subjects.teacher_id     for any subject of C
//
//   and NEVER in timetable_slots.teacher_id.
//
// The timetable exclusion is not a preference. Slot visibility is itself derived
// from teaching the class, so deriving the assignment from the slot would make
// each grant the other. That circularity was the reason for the exclusion when
// it was first settled, and nothing here revisits it. A cover teacher still
// reads their own slot through a separate own-slot policy without that slot
// counting as an assignment.
//
// The authoritative copy of this definition is public.teaches_class(uuid, uuid),
// a SECURITY DEFINER function. The queries below express the same two arms and
// the same exclusion, because a policy helper cannot be used as a client-side
// filter without one round trip per class. RLS enforces teaches_class
// independently on every read, so if the two ever disagreed the database would
// narrow the result, never widen it. That is the intended relationship: this
// code decides what to ask for, RLS decides what may be answered.
//
// TENANT SCOPING. Every query filters school_id and a specific id set. None asks
// broadly and lets RLS narrow it.
//
// WHY SEPARATE QUERIES RATHER THAN EMBEDDED SELECTS. The same reason batch 3
// gave: these tables reach one another through COMPOSITE foreign keys, and a
// silent PostgREST embedding failure would look exactly like "this teacher has
// no classes", which is the bug being fixed.
