// Phase 8 batch 7. Real threads, for whoever is an actual participant.
//
// The prototype filtered mock threads by `participantIds.includes(parentId)`,
// comparing a guardians.id against what are really USER ids, and offered a
// compose control listing the teachers of the child's class. Neither works
// against the real tables: participation is by auth.uid(), and a guardian holds
// no INSERT policy on message_threads or message_thread_participants.
//
// So a guardian replies here and does not start. That is decision 7 applied
// consistently, not a parent-specific restriction.
